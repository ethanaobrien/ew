    "dictionaryComment": "Appears on the Hasunosora Girls' High School Idol Club debut mini-album, Dream Believers. The first song of the Mira-Cra Park! sub-unit. The chiptune intro immediately draws listeners into the sub-unit's unique world. The first and second melody sections have a high-tempo back-and-forth between Rurino and Megumi, showing their humanity. Then suddenly, the chorus transitions into a wildly motivational cheering-type song. The full version expands on the theme part experience, adding more chatter and a drop as hard as you'll find on any roller coaster.",
